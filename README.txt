FOR LIBERAWARE JOB REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

Based on the job description you provided, this package emphasizes:

✓ C/C++ fundamentals (this covers C thoroughly)
✓ Sensor driver implementation (programs 2, 4, 5 cover this)
✓ Embedded system concepts (RTOS explained in guide)
✓ Real-time constraints (program 5 simulates this)
✓ Data structures (programs 3, 4 demonstrate this)

NEXT STEPS after this material:
  1. Learn C++ (extends C, used at Liberaware)
  2. Study microcontroller architecture (ARM Cortex-M basics)
  3. Practice on real hardware with Jetson boards
  4. Learn FreeRTOS or Linux kernel real-time extensions
  5. Study ROS (Robot Operating System)

COMMON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: How long to learn this material?
A: Complete package takes 10-15 hours for theory + practice
   Mastery for embedded engineering takes 3-6 months with projects

Q: Do I need a specific IDE?
A: No! Any text editor + gcc compiler works. Recommended:
   - VS Code with C/C++ extension (free)

   - Hardware knowledge (GPIO, I2C, SPI, interrupts)
   - Specific platform experience (for the role)
   - Projects to show (GitHub, portfolio)

Q: How does this relate to RTOS?
A: Guide explains RTOS concepts. Real learning requires:
   - FreeRTOS tutorials
   - Real hardware with RTOS
   - Task scheduling practice
   - Interrupt handling

================================================================================
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

✓ DO:
  - Type out the programs yourself (don't just copy)
  - Compile with -Wall -Wextra flags (learn to fix warnings)
  - Modify code and experiment
  - Use debugger (gdb) when things don't work
  - Write small programs to practice concepts
  - Keep the cheat sheet visible while coding

✗ DON'T:
  - Just read the materials (you must code!)
  - Skip the programs (they're the core learning)
  - Ignore compiler warnings
  - Try to memorize everything (use references)
  - Jump to advanced topics before understanding basics
  - Get discouraged by pointers (everyone struggles initially)
